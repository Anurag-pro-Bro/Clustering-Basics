# Clustering-Basics US Senators based on how they voted
In this project, we aim to group U.S. Senators based on their voting patterns to explore whether they typically vote along party lines or show independence from party affiliation. By using clustering techniques, we will uncover patterns within the voting data. Clustering algorithms are designed to group similar data points together, helping us identify potential clusters or groups that share common characteristics. This method allows us to better understand the underlying structure of the data. Clustering is a widely used machine learning approach, especially useful for exploring datasets where patterns are not immediately clear.
